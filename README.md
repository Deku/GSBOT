EGSA Broadcaster Bot
===========================
Massive amounts of kudos to UlysseM for the base that we've used for this bot!
Check out the original GroovesharkBroadcast Bot at https://github.com/UlysseM/GSBOT


Create or takeover a broadcast with this bot, then enjoy what the bot can offer!

The EGSA Broadcast Bot (EGSA Bot) is designed to run a collaborative broadcast hosted on a dedicated server.

This bot has specifically been modified for use by EGSA (http://egsa.github.io) so it may not be exactly what you want.
We have added several features and tweaks that we find useful or fun.

Featuring
---------

✓ An interactive chat with "command line interface":

 -Typing /help will give you the list of all available commands

✓ An advanced "takeover" feature:

 -The bot can either starts a new broadcast, takeover an existing one, or recover it from an other tab.

✓ A login feature:

 -You can either use your current session or automatically log into an other one.

✓ A URL-to-startup:

 -To start the bot, simply enter a URL, the rest is automated, which mean you can start the bot from outside the browser (a shortcut on from your desktop or a script can be made in few seconds)!

✓ A never ending broadcast:

 -If the queue runs out, the bot will just pick a random song from your collection.

✓ A whitelist / blacklist system:

 -People on your whitelist can enter command such as /guest to become a 'guest' on your broadcast. A check of a checkbox in the settings will allow you to add every people you follow on this whitelist. If you want to exclude some of them, you may add them to the blacklist.


Instructions
------------


To start the Grooveshark Broadcast Bot, simply go to the following URL in your chrome browser:
  http://broadcast/

Alternatively, if you want to force the log in process, you can go to:
  http://broadcast/YOUR_ID/YOUR_PASSWORD

Once you entered one of these two URLs, DO NOT touch anything, as it would mess up the automated setup process!


Customize
---------


You may change the messages, or other settings by going to the 'Options' page. A link should be provided in your google chrome extension's listing.
